Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RewriteVersion::Sanitized

This is a subclass of "[RewriteVersion]" that applies version
sanitization from all the various possible input sources ( Similar to
"[Git::NextVersion::Sanitized]" ) by applying
"Dist::Zilla::Role::Version::Sanitize" to it.

Using this module instead of "[RewriteVersion]" allows you to do

  V=2.6.0 dzil release

And V will be interpreted as if you'd written "V=2.006000"

For details on the parameters this "plugin" takes, see the documentation
for Dist::Zilla::Role::Version::Sanitize.
